      UN Security Council raises alarm on ‘critical’ situation in
      violence-gripped Haiti
    </h3>

    <p>
      One of the cardinal principles of a functioning and modern democracy is
      that only the state, led by a government that is elected by the people,
      has a legitimate right to use or to authorise the use of physical force.
      When civilian groups resort to violence against state actors without
      repercussions, one has to call into question the maintenance of law and
      order in the State of Manipur. In late February, cadres of the Meitei The
      UN Security Council expressed its concern over the deteriorating situation
      in violence-gripped Haiti on Wednesday, as Washington ramped up pressure
      on absent Prime Minister Ariel Henry to secure a political settlement.
      Armed gangs who control swaths of the country launched a coordinated
      effort to oust Mr. Henry last week, attacking the airport, prisons and
      police stations, while threatening a full-scale civil war.

      85 per cent Indians support rule by a strong leader or military says Pew
      survey
    </h3>

    <p>
      In India, 85% of respondents to a 2023 survey said that military rule or
      rule by an authoritarian leader would be good for the country. India’s
      share was the highest among the 24 countries surveyed. Notably, the share
      of Indians who said that it is important for Opposition parties to operate
      freely was the third lowest among the countries surveyed. In 2023, the
      share of Indians who believed that representative democracy is a good way
      of governance declined considerably from 2017, when the same survey was
      conducted. Interestingly, a very high share of Indians also wanted experts
      to rule and not elected officials. These were some of the conclusions of
      the Pew Research Center’s Spring 2023 Global Attitudes Survey. In India,
      face-to-face interviews were conducted between March 25 and May 11, 2023,
      among adults. The north-eastern States and the Andaman and Nicobar and
      Lakshadweep Islands were excluded. The sample was selected in a way that
      proportionally represents Indians across gender, age, education, region,
      and urbanity.

      justice
    </h3>
    <p>
      The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) on its 66th
      Youm-e-Tasees orRevival Day celebrated on March 2, reaffirmed its
      commitment to fighting the Bharatiya Janata Party and espousing the cause
      of Muslims, Dalits, Adivasis as well as other marginalised groups. The

      Majlis were handed over to the Abdul Wahid Owaisi, a lawyer, who was
      current AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi’s grandfather. In his first
      speech as the president of a different manifestation of the Majlis, the
      lawyer spoke of improving socio-economic conditions of Muslims and invoked
      the Constitution of India.
