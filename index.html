      Law and disorder: on Manipur, its ethnic polarisation and its law and
      order
    </h3>

    <p>
      One of the cardinal principles of a functioning and modern democracy is
      that only the state, led by a government that is elected by the people,
      has a legitimate right to use or to authorise the use of physical force.
      When civilian groups resort to violence against state actors without
      repercussions, one has to call into question the maintenance of law and
      order in the State of Manipur. In late February, cadres of the Meitei
      chauvinist group, the Arambai Tenggol, allegedly abducted a police
      officer, assaulted him and vandalised his home. Police officers protested
      the attack, lamenting their inability to take action against the group. It
      is another matter that the group has managed to source its weapons from
      the looting of police stations in the valley following the ethnic
      conflagration last May. Many of the weapons are yet to be seized or
      returned despite the government’s appeals. The police in the valley are
      heavily ethnicised with barely any representation from the Kuki-Zo
      minority. Yet, the impunity with which the Arambai Tenggol has acted
      against a police official, and even assaulted a leader of the opposition
      in the recent past besides administering oath to legislators from the
      valley to pledge for its majoritarian cause, suggest that such actions
      have either the nod of the leadership of the State government or have been
      deliberately ignored. The severe ethnicisation in the valley and the hills
      has also granted a degree of popularity to groups such as the Arambai
      Tenggol and counterparts in the hills, making law enforcement difficult to
      achieve.

    <h3>T.N. Cash-for-votes: Post-EC warning, police devise strategies</h3>

    <p>
      With the Election Commission of India (ECI) cracking the whip on providing
      cash for votes and warning bureaucrats to take action or face action, the
      Tamil Nadu police are chalking out elaborate strategies to effectively
      curb distribution of money or freebies to voters by political parties. In
      a two-day meeting chaired by the Chief Election Commissioner of India,
      Rajiv Kumar, and Election Commissioner of India Arun Goel with IAS/IPS
      officers here last week and the communications that followed, the ECI had
      minced no words in conveying the message that any incident involving
      distribution of freebies or money to voters would mean “severe” action on
      the concerned Commissioner/Superintendent of Police that might impact
      their career, sources said on Sunday. Though there was an option to place
      the Flying Squad Teams (FST) and Static Surveillance Teams (SST) at the
      disposal of Poll Observers, the ECI said that the teams would remain under
      the command of the Returning Officers (Collectors) or Commissioners or
      SPs. However, the commission would not hesitate to change its mind if the
      desired results were not achieved, the sources added.

      IED blast: No breakthrough yet; Siddaramaiah says will consider NIA probe
    </h3>
    <p>
      Two days after an IED blast rocked Rameshwaram Cafe in Brookefield, near
      Whitefield in the city, the Bengaluru police are yet to make any
      breakthrough in the case, even as multiple teams are working to crack it.
      Meanwhile, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said on Sunday that the State
      government would consider handing over the probe to the National
      Investigation Agency (NIA). However, accusing the BJP of trying to
      politicise the episode, he trained his guns at the Centre by wondering if
      the blast episode was not a failure of Central agencies like the NIA, IB
      and RAW.

    <h3>Kozhikode Corporation’s Kudumbashree IT unit bags national award</h3>
    <p>
      Technoworld IT unit under the Kozhikode Corporation Kudumbashree has been
      selected as one of the six best woman entrepreneurships in the country by
      the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. It is the only enterprise from
      Kerala to win the award. The unit was founded by five women in March 2004
      and has gradually grown into a state where they handle the Corporation’s
      kiosk, Motor Vehicles department Seva Kendra, hospital kiosks, training
      centre, printing press, and a plan facilitation centre, besides carrying
      out data entry for various government departments. It is the State
      government’s approved agency for data entry, and has the right to take up
      data entry and printing works for various government departments without
      the tender proceedings.

      AIMIM’s battle cry for Lok Sabha polls: renewed commitment to social
      justice
    </h3>
    <p>
      The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) on its 66th
      Youm-e-Tasees orRevival Day celebrated on March 2, reaffirmed its
      commitment to fighting the Bharatiya Janata Party and espousing the cause
      of Muslims, Dalits, Adivasis as well as other marginalised groups. The
      party’s revival day marks the moment when the reins of the erstwhile
      Majlis were handed over to the Abdul Wahid Owaisi, a lawyer, who was
      current AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi’s grandfather. In his first
      speech as the president of a different manifestation of the Majlis, the
      lawyer spoke of improving socio-economic conditions of Muslims and invoked
      the Constitution of India.
