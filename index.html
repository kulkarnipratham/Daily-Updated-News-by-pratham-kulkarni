      Adilabad MP Bapu Rao hints at contesting elections despite denial of
      ticket from party
    </h3>

    <p>
      Accusing some party leaders from Telangana of attempting to influence the
      BJP high command against declaring him as the party candidate for the Lok
      Sabha elections from Adilabad constituency, sitting MP Soyam Bapu Rao has
      hinted that he might contest the upcoming elections despite being denied a
      ticket in the second list. Expressing his displeasure over the omission of
      his name in the first list of BJP candidates selected for the Lok Sabha
      polls from Telangana, he said, “Some prominent leaders are obstructing my
      growth as they believe that I would be given a ministerial berth if
      re-elected from the Adilabad constituency. But I am not depending on
      anyone. I will make my own decision if denied the ticket. However, I have
      faith in the leadership that they would announce my candidature in the
      second list,” he told the media in Adilabad on Sunday. It may be mentioned
      here that the BJP announced the names of nine candidates to contest in the
      forthcoming Lok Sabha elections from Telangana on Saturday. The party
      leadership has renominated three of the four sitting MPs — G. Kishan Reddy
      (Secunderabad), Bandi Sanjay (Karimnagar), and Dharmapuri Arvind
      (Nizamabad), but has kept the candidature of Adilabad pending.

    <h3>T.N. Cash-for-votes: Post-EC warning, police devise strategies</h3>

    <p>
      With the Election Commission of India (ECI) cracking the whip on providing
      cash for votes and warning bureaucrats to take action or face action, the
      Tamil Nadu police are chalking out elaborate strategies to effectively
      curb distribution of money or freebies to voters by political parties. In
      a two-day meeting chaired by the Chief Election Commissioner of India,
      Rajiv Kumar, and Election Commissioner of India Arun Goel with IAS/IPS
      officers here last week and the communications that followed, the ECI had
      minced no words in conveying the message that any incident involving
      distribution of freebies or money to voters would mean “severe” action on
      the concerned Commissioner/Superintendent of Police that might impact
      their career, sources said on Sunday. Though there was an option to place
      the Flying Squad Teams (FST) and Static Surveillance Teams (SST) at the
      disposal of Poll Observers, the ECI said that the teams would remain under
      the command of the Returning Officers (Collectors) or Commissioners or
      SPs. However, the commission would not hesitate to change its mind if the
      desired results were not achieved, the sources added.

      IED blast: No breakthrough yet; Siddaramaiah says will consider NIA probe
    </h3>
    <p>
      Two days after an IED blast rocked Rameshwaram Cafe in Brookefield, near
      Whitefield in the city, the Bengaluru police are yet to make any
      breakthrough in the case, even as multiple teams are working to crack it.
      Meanwhile, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said on Sunday that the State
      government would consider handing over the probe to the National
      Investigation Agency (NIA). However, accusing the BJP of trying to
      politicise the episode, he trained his guns at the Centre by wondering if
      the blast episode was not a failure of Central agencies like the NIA, IB
      and RAW.

      AIMIM’s battle cry for Lok Sabha polls: renewed commitment to social
      justice
    </h3>
    <p>
      The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) on its 66th
      Youm-e-Tasees orRevival Day celebrated on March 2, reaffirmed its
      commitment to fighting the Bharatiya Janata Party and espousing the cause
      of Muslims, Dalits, Adivasis as well as other marginalised groups. The
      party’s revival day marks the moment when the reins of the erstwhile
      Majlis were handed over to the Abdul Wahid Owaisi, a lawyer, who was
      current AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi’s grandfather. In his first
      speech as the president of a different manifestation of the Majlis, the
      lawyer spoke of improving socio-economic conditions of Muslims and invoked
      the Constitution of India.
